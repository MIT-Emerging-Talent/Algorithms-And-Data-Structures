## Generating all combinations of k integers from 0 to n

Given two integers n and k, the problem is to generate all possible combinations of k integers from 0 to n (inclusive).

For example, if n = 4 and k = 2, the possible combinations are:

```
(0, 1)
(0, 2)
(0, 3)
(0, 4)
(1, 2)
(1, 3)
(1, 4)
(2, 3)
(2, 4)
(3, 4)
```

## Approach

One approach to solve this problem is to use a backtracking strategy.

A backtracking algorithm works by starting with an empty combination and adding elements to it one at a time, then exploring the resulting combinations, and backtracking (removing the last added element) when it is no longer possible to generate new combinations.

To implement the backtracking algorithm, we can use a recursive function that takes three arguments:

* `n`: the upper limit of the range of integers from which the combinations are drawn.
* `k`: the length of the combinations.
* `combination`: the current combination being generated.

The function can follow these steps:

1. If the length of combination is equal to k, it means that a combination of the desired length has been found. In this case, the function can append the combination to a list of results and return.

1. If the length of combination is not equal to k, the function can enter a loop that starts at the smallest integer not present in combination and goes up to n + 1.

1. For each iteration of the loop, the function can call itself recursively with n, k, and combination + [i] (to add the current integer to the combination).

1. After the loop, the function can return the list of results.

The time complexity of this approach is $O(n * C(n,k)) = O(n * (n!/(k! * (n - k)!)))$, where $C(n,k)$ is the binomial coefficient, which represents the number of ways to choose k elements from a set of n elements.
