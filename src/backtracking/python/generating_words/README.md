## Generate words from a board of letters

Given a board represented as a list of lists of characters, and a dictionary of valid words, the function should find all the words that can be formed on the board by following a path that starts at any letter and goes to any of its neighbors (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally). A word is considered valid if it is present in the dictionary of valid words.

For example, if the board is:

```
[
    ['a', 'b', 'c'],
    ['d', 'e', 'f'],
    ['g', 'h', 'i']
]
```

and the dictionary of valid words is:

```
['abc', 'aei', 'cfg']
```

the function should return:

```
['abc', 'aei']
```


## Approach

The generate_words function solves this problem using a depth-first search (DFS) algorithm. It iterates over all the letters on the board, and for each letter it uses DFS to explore all the possible paths that start at that letter and go to its neighbors. As it explores each path, it appends the letters to a word, and it checks whether the word is a valid word by looking it up in the dictionary of valid words. If the word is valid, it adds it to a set of generated words. This way, each valid word is added to the set only once, even if it is formed by more than one path.

The time complexity of this function is $O(3^n * n * m)$, where n is the number of rows and m is the number of columns in the board. This is due to the fact that the DFS algorithm has to explore all the possible paths on the board, and each path has a maximum length of $3^n$ (since each letter has at most 3 neighbors).
