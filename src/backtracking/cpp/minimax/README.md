## Tic-Tac-Toe with Minimax Algorithm

The tic-tac-toe game is a classic two-player game where each player takes turns placing their mark (either an "X" or an "O") on a 3x3 grid. The player who gets three of their marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game. If all the squares on the grid are filled and no player has won, the game is a draw.

To create an AI player for tic-tac-toe, we can use the minimax algorithm. The minimax algorithm is a decision-making strategy that aims to maximize the player's score while minimizing the opponent's score. It works by recursively exploring all possible moves and their consequences, and choosing the move that leads to the best score for the player.

## Approach

In the case of tic-tac-toe, the minimax algorithm can be implemented as follows:

1. First, we define a score function that takes a board as input and returns 1 if the player wins, -1 if the opponent wins, and 0 if the game is a draw.
1. Then, we define a minimax function that takes the board and the current player as input. This function recursively explores all possible moves and their consequences, and returns the best score and the corresponding move for the player.
1. To make the AI player take a turn, we call the minimax function with the current board and the player's mark as arguments. The function returns the best score and the corresponding move, and the player places their mark on the board at the returned move.
1. The game continues until either the player or the opponent wins, or the game is a draw.

## Complexity

Using the minimax algorithm, we can create an AI player that is unbeatable at tic-tac-toe. The complexity of the algorithm is O(3^n), where n is the number of empty squares on the board. This means that the algorithm is efficient enough for small games like tic-tac-toe, but may not be suitable for larger games with more possible moves.
